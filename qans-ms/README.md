# Resource Description Framework

## _**RDF**_ is a data model for describing things (web resources) and their interrelations.

  * Resources are decribed in terms of properties and property values using RDF statements.

  * Statements in RDF are _Triples_ consisting of *subject*, *predicate* and *object*.

     For example: Alia sells books.

                 Subject : Alia, Predicate : sells, Object : books
                 
  * Subject and predicate could be URIs whereas object could be URIs or literals.

  * Triples are usually graphs.

  * Subjects and objects are represented by nodes whereas predicates by links or edges.

  * _Uniform Resource Identifier_ (URI) - string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the internet. 

  * Common _Serialization Formats_ are:

                    Turtle
                    N-Triples
                    N-Quads    
                    N3/Notation3      
                    JSON-LD
                    RDF/XML
                    RDF/JSON
