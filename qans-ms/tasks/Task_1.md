# Task 1 of the Second Phase of Project

#### To create 50 questions that is answerable on the sentences in OKE 2018 (Open Knowledge Extraction). 

In order to frame 50 questions you can use the [OKE 2018](https://project-hobbit.eu/challenges/oke2018-challenge-eswc-2018/) link.

In that link go to Tasks & Training Data. Then at the end of the page there is a section named Data under that click on the dataset that belongs to Task 4 from which you can frame questions.

If you want to get acquainted with an example on how to frame questions, just click on Task 4 and try to understand what's it all about.

From the Task 4 we can elucidate an example and here it goes:
  
There is a string or in a layman's term a sentence: "Conor McGregor's longtime trainer, John Kavanagh, is ready to shock the world."
        
A question that can be framed would look like **"Who is the trainer of Conor McGregor?"**
        
This appropriate question is taken from the response data [check the link](https://project-hobbit.eu/challenges/oke2018-challenge-eswc-2018/tasks/#task4) where “dbo:trainer dbr:Conor_McGregor” .

After framing such 50 questions from the dataset, you are supposed to bulid SPARQL queries on each of them which will be explained in the upcoming task.
